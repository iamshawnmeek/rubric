# The PreToolUse entrypoint for the worktree lease guard.
#
# TRACKED ON PURPOSE, AND MACHINE-AGNOSTIC ON PURPOSE — those two facts are the whole reason
# this file exists rather than a hook command in .claude/settings.json naming the binary
# directly. `.claude/settings.json` is tracked, so it crosses into every worktree, but the
# COMMAND it names has to resolve on the other side, and both obvious spellings fail there:
#
#   "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"/.showrunner/bin/showrunner
#       In a worktree, CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is the WORKTREE (verified, WL-01), and .showrunner/
#       is runtime state that `git worktree add` does not carry — it copies TRACKED files
#       only. Dead on arrival in exactly the place the guard is for.
#
#   an absolute path to this machine's checkout, baked into the tracked file
#       Resolves here and is wrong in every other clone. (Not spelled out even as an example:
#       this repo is public and a tracked file carrying somebody's home directory is a rule a
#       stranger inherits — the suite scans for exactly that, and caught this comment.)
#
# So the tracked thing is this shim, which resolves the MAIN checkout at run time the same way
# util.main_checkout does — via --git-common-dir, whose value is the main checkout's .git even
# when called from inside a linked worktree.
#
# FAIL OPEN, NEVER IN SILENCE. When no binary can be found this ALLOWS the tool call and says
# so. A PreToolUse hook that exits non-zero blocks every Write/Edit/Bash including the one
# that would repair it, so hard-failing on our own plumbing would lock the repo against its
# own fix. But allowing without a word is indistinguishable from a guard that ran and was
# content, which is how a rail goes quiet exactly where it is blind — so the allow announces
# itself, `showrunner doctor` reports the absence as an error, and `worktree enter` says one
# line into agent context when the guard is inert.
#
# Keep this file trivially correct. All real logic lives in `showrunner worktree guard`.

# THE SAME LEDGER THE CLI WRITES, so a fail-open from either entrypoint is countable. The
# notice reaches an agent mid-task and is reliably skimmed; a COUNT that `doctor` reports is
# read by somebody who has stopped to look. Best-effort — a ledger that cannot be written must
# never turn a fail-open into a hard failure, which would block the write that repairs it.

# CWD IS WHERE THE SHELL STANDS; IT IS NOT WHAT THE COMMAND WRITES. Resolving only from cwd
# made this guard strongest exactly where it is least needed — already inside the repo — and
# absent exactly where a stray absolute path is most likely, which is a scratch directory.
# Working from a scratchpad is the ordinary shape of orchestration, not a mistake, and a
# consumer reported DOZENS of unchecked calls in one session from precisely that.
#
# So when cwd cannot answer, ask the HARNESS. CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is the session's own notion of
# where it is working and is set for every hook invocation; in a worktree it is the WORKTREE,
# which is the answer this guard wants. Failing open is now what happens when BOTH cannot
# answer, rather than when the shell happens to be standing somewhere else.

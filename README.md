A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

## Development

## Sort Your Imports

A script has been added to the root directory of this application called `sort_imports.sh`

Run the following command to sort all imports in the project. Hint: Run this before you create a PR!
```bash
./sort_imports.sh
```

If you get a permissions error, grant execute permissions and try again:

#### Grant Execute Permissions Permanently
```bash
chmod +x ./sort_imports.sh
```

#### Grant Temporary Permissions
```bash
sudo ./sort_imports.sh
```
